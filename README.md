# CRUD-Applications

These CRUD applications were developed for a research project in a comparative study between Angular and React. They are the same simple CRUD system made with Material Design (Material Angular for Angular and Material-UI for React) as a UI. Add item to table, edit item in the table and delete item functions are implementad, as well as the visual in both.

Feel free to use it as you like.

## Useful Files
Some useful files with the metrics results from the research. You can find them in the [main](https://github.com/AdrysonFreitas/CRUD-Applications/) folder.

### [Runs.txt](https://github.com/AdrysonFreitas/CRUD-Applications/blob/main/Runs.txt)
It has all the data collected from the 10 runs from the two frameworks

### [Metrics Results.pdf](https://github.com/AdrysonFreitas/CRUD-Applications/blob/main/Metrics%20Results.pdf)
It has all the data collected from the 10 runs, but organized in tables and graphs for a better visualization.
