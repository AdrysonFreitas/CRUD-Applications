# Simple CRUD in React using MUI Material Design UI.

A simple CRUD developed in React with Typescript and MUI for my final paper. It does the basics of add new user, edit, delete and show in a table. The columns and data were generated randomly.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
