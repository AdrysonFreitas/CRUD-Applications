# Simple CRUD in Angular using Angular Material as UI.

A simple CRUD developed in Angular with Typescript and Angular Material for my final paper. It does the basics of add new user, edit, delete and show in a table. The columns and data were generated randomly.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `ng serve`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learn More

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
